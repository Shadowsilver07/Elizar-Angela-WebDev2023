<!-- BE Web Development -->

What exactly is a Full-Stack Web Developer?
Full-Stack = Front End + Back End
Front End: Client-side (User Interface), static the Restaurant
Back End: Server-side (Server, Application and Database), dynamic the Kitchen and Pantry
- Well, it's the combination of knowing about how to work with the frontend,
- so the client-facing side and also how to work with the backend, which is the side that's invisible
- to the user, but contains all the logic that makes a web application work.

What is the Back End?
- It consists of 3 main components. - Server, Application and Database
1. Server 
- Server, which is basically just a computer, any computer connected to a network can act as a server
- when we're going to be building our websites locally, we're going to be using something called localhost, 
- which means we're going to be using our own computer as the server in order to serve up the websites that we create. 
- But when we're going to be deploying our websites to the internet, we're going to be using a remote server, which is a computer that's connected to the internet and is managed by a company

2. Application - Application, which is all the logic that enables the web app to function.
- The application is essentially a set of logic that runs on the computer, the server. This logic determines how to respond to requests from the browser.

A. Request Handling
When a user clicks a button, that request travels from the browser to the server and then to the application. The application recognizes that the specific button clicked should trigger the return of a particular HTML page. It sends that HTML page back to the browser, allowing the user to view a new webpage.

B. Different Response Types
In addition to HTML pages, the application can respond with other types of information, such as:

1. Data: The application may send back structured data, typically in formats like JSON or XML.
2. Status Codes: The application can also return status codes to inform the browser of the outcome of the request.

C. Example: Status Code "404"
- A common status code you may encounter is "404". This code indicates that the application is notifying the browser that the requested page is invalid or does not exist.



Other Add ons:
- An application in the backend refers to the server-side component of a software system that processes requests, manages data, and handles business logic. Here are some key points about backend applications:

A. Server-Side Logic: The backend application runs on a server and contains the logic that determines how to process requests from users or other systems.

B. Data Management: It interacts with databases to store, retrieve, and manipulate data. This includes tasks like user authentication, data validation, and business rule enforcement.

C. APIs: Backend applications often expose APIs that allow frontend applications (like websites or mobile apps) to communicate with them. This enables the frontend to request data or perform actions.

D. Frameworks and Languages: Backend applications can be built using various programming languages (like Python, Java, Ruby, Node.js) and frameworks (like Django, Express, Spring) that provide tools and libraries to streamline development.

E. Performance and Scalability: Backend applications need to be efficient and scalable to handle multiple user requests and ensure a smooth experience.

- In essence, the backend application is responsible for everything that happens behind the scenes to support the user experience on the frontend.


3. Database - Database, where you can store and retrieve user data.
- Database, which is a collection of data that's organized in a way that makes it easy to access and modify. Think of it like a library, where you can store books,
- and then you can go in and retrieve books, and you can also add new books to the library.





API 
- API, which stands for Application Programming Interface, which is basically just a set of rules that define how different software components can communicate with each other.
- So, when we're building a web application, we're going to be using the API to communicate with the database, and then we're going to be using the API to communicate with the
server.

The main differences between an Application and an API are:

A. Definition:

- Application: A software program designed to perform specific tasks for users, like a web browser or a mobile app.
- API: A set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

B. Function:

- Application: Directly interacts with users, providing a user interface and functionalities (like displaying web pages or processing data).
- API: Acts as an intermediary that enables different applications to exchange data and functionality without user interaction.

C. User Interaction:

- Application: Typically has a graphical user interface (GUI) that users interact with.
- API: Usually does not have a user interface; itâ€™s accessed programmatically by other applications.

D. Purpose:

- Application: Focuses on delivering specific tasks or services to users.
- API: Facilitates communication and data sharing between different systems or applications.

In summary, an application is what users interact with, while an API is a tool that allows different applications to work together.
