<!-- Forking and Pull Request -->

# Forking in Git (particularly on platforms like GitHub) is the process of creating a personal copy of someone else's repository. Hereâ€™s what it entails:

    1. Personal Copy: When you fork a repository, you get your own version of that repository under your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.

    2. Collaboration: Forking is commonly used in open-source projects, allowing you to propose changes or enhancements. After making changes in your fork, you can submit a pull request to the original repository to suggest your modifications.

    3. Independent Development: You can experiment, make features, or fix bugs in your forked repository independently of the original project.

    In Summary
    Forking is a key feature for collaboration in Git, enabling developers to contribute to projects while maintaining their own version.
