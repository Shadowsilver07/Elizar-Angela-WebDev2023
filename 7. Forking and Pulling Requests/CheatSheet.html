<!-- Forking and Pull Request -->

# Forking in Git (particularly on platforms like GitHub) is the process of creating a personal copy of someone else's repository. Hereâ€™s what it entails:

    1. Personal Copy: When you fork a repository, you get your own version of that repository under your GitHub account. This allows you to make changes without affecting the original project.

    2. Collaboration: Forking is commonly used in open-source projects, allowing you to propose changes or enhancements. After making changes in your fork, you can submit a pull request to the original repository to suggest your modifications.

    3. Independent Development: You can experiment, make features, or fix bugs in your forked repository independently of the original project.

    In Summary
    Forking is a key feature for collaboration in Git, enabling developers to contribute to projects while maintaining their own version.


# Collaboration between Remote Repository and GitHub for Teamwork
# Making a copy on you GitHub account 
# Different from git clone, which is grabbing the entirety from repository then cloning it
# Copy repository that is hosted from GitHub and you are making a copy under your own GitHub account where you can make changes to it.
# making a copy or duplicate of the Github repository of another owner and putting it on your own GitHub account
# This is called - Forking

Once you fork a remote repository you now own it 
You will have full permission to do whatever you like
