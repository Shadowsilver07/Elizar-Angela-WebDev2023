# The space repitition 
- repeat review from now, after a week, after end of the month, another month.
- you need to repeat learning to not forget. 

The space repetition is a technique used to improve memory retention. It involves repeating information in short intervals with
intervals of time in between. This can be done with any type of information, such as words
, phrases, or even entire texts. The space repetition technique is based on the psychological concept of the
spaced repetition effect, which states that information learned at increasingly longer intervals will be retained longer.
The space repetition technique can be used in a variety of ways, such as:

1. Flashcards: Write a word or phrase on one side of a flashcard and the definition or
meaning on the other. Review the flashcard at increasingly longer intervals to help solidify the information in
memory.
2. Spaced repetition software: There are many software programs available that can help you implement the space repetition
technique, such as Anki or Quizlet.
* Mnemonic devices: Create a mnemonic device, such as a rhyme or acronym, to help you
remember information. Review the mnemonic device at increasingly longer intervals to help solidify the information in memory.


The space repetition technique can be used to improve memory retention in a variety of ways, such as:
* Improving vocabulary: Use flashcards or spaced repetition software to review words and their meanings at increasingly
longer intervals.
* Improving knowledge: Use spaced repetition software or mnemonic devices to review information at increasingly longer
intervals.
