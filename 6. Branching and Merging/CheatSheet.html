<!-- Branching and Merging -->

Feature development with branches
Main: 1 > 2 > 3

# Instead of continuing to Main we create a side branch for Feature
# From 2 to side 3
Feature: 3 > 4
git branch <name-of-branch>


# We can still continue with the changes from the Main branch and parallel to the Feature branch
# We can develop both simultaneously

# When we decide to merge the feature branch to the main branch 
# This can be done by placing a merge request
git merge <name-of-branch>

    Main: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 # Where Feature 4 is merged to Main 4
    Feature: 3 > 4


# git push origin main -u
    The command git push origin main -u is used to push your local changes to a remote repository on GitHub (or another Git server). Here's a breakdown of each part:

    - git push: This is the command to upload your local commits to a remote repository.
    
    - origin: This is the default name for your remote repository. When you clone a repository, Git automatically names it "origin". You can think of it as a shorthand reference to the remote repository URL.
    
    - main: This specifies the branch you want to push. In this case, it's the main branch.
    
    -u or --set-upstream: This option sets the upstream tracking reference for the branch. This means that after you run this command, your local main branch will be linked to the remote main branch. This allows you to use git push or git pull in the future without needing to specify the remote and branch names again.
    
    In Summary
    So, running git push origin main -u will:
    
    Push your local main branch to the origin remote repository.
    Set the local main branch to track the origin/main branch, simplifying future pushes and pulls.


# The difference between the git push -u origin main
The difference between git push origin main and git push -u origin main lies in the tracking behavior:

    1. git push origin main: This command pushes your local main branch to the origin remote repository. However, it does not set any tracking relationship. If you run this command, youâ€™ll need to specify the remote and branch again for future pushes.

    2. git push -u origin main: This command does the same as the first, but it also sets the local main branch to track the origin/main branch. After using this command, you can simply use git push or git pull in the future without specifying the remote and branch, as it remembers the relationship.

    In Summary
    Use -u to simplify future pushes/pulls by establishing a tracking relationship.
    Without -u, you have to specify the remote and branch each time.



# To create a new branch under main using Git Bash in VSCode, you can follow these steps:

    Step 1: Open Git Bash
    Make sure you have your terminal open in the project directory.
    
    Step 2: Fetch Latest Changes (Optional)
    If you want to ensure you're up to date with the remote main, you can run:
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main

    Step 3: Create a New Branch
    To create a new branch from main, use the following command:
    git checkout -b your-new-branch-name
    Replace your-new-branch-name with the name you want to give your new branch.

    Step 4: Push the New Branch to Remote
    After creating your new branch, you can push it to the remote repository:
    git push -u origin <your-new-branch-name>

This command not only pushes the new branch to the remote but also sets up the tracking relationship so you can use git push and git pull without specifying the branch name later.

    In Summary:
    
    1. Check out the main branch and pull the latest changes (optional):
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main

    2. Create and switch to a new branch:
    git checkout -b your-new-branch-name

    3. Push the new branch to the remote:
    git push -u origin <your-new-branch-name>

Extended:
1. Exercise:
a. I am currently working on a project that is named feature as a branch and it is open in my vscode with git bash and i like to push it to another project that is in Github with the main branch 
-- i wanted the feature branch as another branch under the main branch

To push your feature(new) branch to another project in GitHub as a new branch under its main branch, you can follow these steps using Git Bash in VSCode:
Steps to Push Your Feature Branch to Another Repository > See picture: New Branch to another Branch in Github

Name of New branch is Feature:
git remote add other-repo https://github.com/username/other-repo.git
git branch (to check your current branch)
git push other-repo feature:Feature



b. To make changes to your feature(new) branch and push those changes to the same branch, follow these steps in Git Bash within VSCode: > See picture: New Branch Add and Push to Main


git remote -v (to check remote configuration)
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repo.git (if origin is missing)
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/username/repo.git (if origin is incorrect)
git push -u origin feature (to push your changes)
