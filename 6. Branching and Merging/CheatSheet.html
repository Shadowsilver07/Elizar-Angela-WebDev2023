<!-- Branching and Merging -->

Feature development with branches
Main: 1 > 2 > 3

# Instead of continuing to Main we create a side branch for Feature
# From 2 to side 3
Feature: 3 > 4
git branch <name-of-branch>


# We can still continue with the changes from the Main branch and parallel to the Feature branch
# We can develop both simultaneously

# When we decide to merge the feature branch to the main branch 
# This can be done by placing a merge request
git merge <name-of-branch>

    Main: 1 > 2 > 3 > 4 > 5 # Where Feature 4 is merged to Main 4
    Feature: 3 > 4
