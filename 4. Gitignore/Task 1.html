# Practice


1. created Sample folder
mkdir Sample

2. Created files
touch file1.txt
touch file2.txt
touch file3.txt secrets.txt
ls

3. Created .gitignore file

4. Created Working Directory
git init

5. Push to the Staging Area
git add .
git status # see status

6. This removes all the added file to the staging area
git rm --cached -r .

# Explanation on the above code
git: This is a tool for tracking changes in code.

rm: This stands for "remove." It’s a command used to delete something.

--cached: This option means you're removing files from the staging area (the area where files are prepared to be committed) but not deleting them from your actual hard drive.

-r: This stands for "recursive." It means you want to apply the command to all files and folders inside the current directory.

.: This represents the current directory. So, you’re telling Git to look at everything in the current folder and its subfolders.

Putting it all together, git rm --cached -r . removes all files from the staging area without deleting them from your computer. It’s useful if you want to stop tracking files in Git but keep them in your project.


7. Open the .gitignore file to a new tab then type the file name you want to be ignored
# Ignored and not be added to Staging Area

secrets.txt

8. Add to the Staging
git add .

9. Push or commit to the Git / Local Repo
git commit -m "Initial commit" # commit with a message
