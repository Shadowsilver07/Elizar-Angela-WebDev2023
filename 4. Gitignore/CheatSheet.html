<!-- Git Ignore -->
The .gitignore file prevents files and folders from being added to the staging area in the first place. 
If a file or folder is already tracked by Git (added to the staging area or committed), it won’t be ignored until you remove it from tracking. 
After that, it will be ignored in future commits.

# This removes all the added file to the staging area
git rm --cached -r .

Explanation:
git: This is a tool for tracking changes in code.

rm: This stands for "remove." It’s a command used to delete something.

--cached: This option means you're removing files from the staging area (the area where files are prepared to be committed) but not deleting them from your actual hard drive.

-r: This stands for "recursive." It means you want to apply the command to all files and folders inside the current directory.

.: This represents the current directory. So, you’re telling Git to look at everything in the current folder and its subfolders.

Putting it all together, git rm --cached -r . removes all files from the staging area without deleting them from your computer. It’s useful if you want to stop tracking files in Git but keep them in your project.


Instruction:
# Open the .gitignore file to a new tab then type the file name you want to be ignored
# Ignored and not be added to Staging Area
# You can also add comment for better tracking -- #
Sample:
secrets.txt
file1.txt
.DS_Store
# Log files not be included in staging area


# This uses wildcard (*) so all of the files that you are going to commit will be ignored
*.log 
*.txt



# Add the folder name you want to ignore. For example, if you want to ignore a folder named logs, you would add:
logs/

# If the folder is nested, include the path relative to the root of your repository. For example, to ignore folder/subfolder, you would write:
folder/subfolder/


# To ignore all folders with a specific name anywhere in your project, you can use:
foldername/
