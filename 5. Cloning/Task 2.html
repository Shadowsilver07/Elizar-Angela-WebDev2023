# Clone Word Mastermind from Github to local repo


1. Go to Github and search for Quakejs
2. Go to Git Bash / Terminal and Type the below
git clone https://github.com/clupasq/word-mastermind.git


3. cd word-mastermind/

# Troubleshooting
    1. npm install
    2. npm install @fastify/static

    Next:
    node src/server.js # issue 
    3. searched src/server.js 
        - open the file and looked for > const fastifyStatic = require("fastify-static") > made it a comment
        - replaced / added const fastifyStatic = require("@fastify/static") > saved

    4. update the fastify-static import to @fastify/static since it's deprecated. 
    Lastly the error that indicates that you're still passing the port incorrectly in the listen call. 
    It should be an object with both port and host properties. Update your listen line to this:
        - on the same filesrc/server.js
        - searched and look for await fastify.listen > this is to modify it - I just made it a comment again 
        - replaced it with > await fastify.listen({ port: port, host: address || '0.0.0.0' });  > saved the files

    5. npm start

5. Open the browser and run it http://127.0.0.1:3333/ > Working!!
