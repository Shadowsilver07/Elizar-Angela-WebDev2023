# Git and Github

Steps:
1. git init
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "first commit"

# Can disregard this is only for creation of remote repository 
4. git remote add origin https://github.com/Shadowsilver07/Github-Training-3.git

5. git push -u origin main

# Roles and Task of DevOps

A DevOps engineer plays a crucial role in the software development lifecycle, bridging the gap between development and operations. Here are some key responsibilities related to Git and version control:

1. Automation: They automate the deployment process using CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipelines, which can include automated tests and deployments whenever code is pushed to a repository.

2. Collaboration: They foster collaboration between development and operations teams, ensuring that everyone is on the same page regarding version control practices.

3. Monitoring and Feedback: They set up monitoring tools to track the performance of applications and gather feedback from the deployed code, facilitating quick responses to issues.

4. Infrastructure as Code: They often use tools like Terraform or Ansible to manage infrastructure in a version-controlled manner, similar to application code.

5. Best Practices: They implement best practices for using Git, such as branching strategies, code reviews, and proper commit messages to maintain a clean and efficient workflow.

6. Overall, DevOps engineers help streamline processes, reduce errors, and improve the speed and reliability of software delivery.


# The percentage of focus for a DevOps engineer can vary based on the organization and specific projects, but here's a rough estimate of how they might allocate their efforts among those key responsibilities:

1. Automation: 40%
    - Automation of CI/CD processes is often a major focus, as it significantly improves deployment speed and reduces human error.

2. Collaboration: 20%
    - Fostering collaboration between teams is crucial, as effective communication can lead to smoother processes and fewer misunderstandings.

3. Monitoring and Feedback: 15%
    - Setting up monitoring and feedback mechanisms is important to ensure applications perform well and issues are identified early.

4. Infrastructure as Code: 15%
    - Managing infrastructure through code helps maintain consistency and version control in deployment environments.

5. Best Practices: 10%
    - Implementing best practices in version control and development processes ensures long-term sustainability and maintainability.

These percentages are flexible and can shift based on project needs, team structure, and organizational goals!
