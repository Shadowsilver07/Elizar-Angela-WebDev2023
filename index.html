# The Importance of Sleep

Today, I want to talk about something that may seem silly: the importance of sleep. Who doesn’t know how to sleep, right? Yet, over the past few years, I’ve discovered several practices that have genuinely helped me.

When I was training in surgery, there was a prevailing mindset among my peers: to be truly dedicated, you had to be able to function on little sleep. People would boast about how they managed on just two hours of rest. At the time, I found it impressive. I thought, “Wow, they’re so hardcore! They work hard and sacrifice sleep for it.”

However, as I gained more experience and began to measure my brain performance more objectively, I realized how misguided this thinking was. Sleep is vital; it helps our brains clear away the buildup of the day’s byproducts and allows us to regenerate.

After nights of only two or three hours of sleep, I feel the consequences the next day. I can handle routine tasks, but creativity? Learning? Those are nearly impossible. My brain struggles to make connections. It made me question why I was living like a zombie for the sake of approval when I knew I could be a better version of myself with proper rest.

I’ve also noticed that I’m much friendlier when I’m well-rested. To improve my sleep routine, I started setting an alarm about an hour before bedtime—not to wake up, but to wind down. This alarm signals it’s time to turn off screens and relax. I even wear red-tinted glasses in the evening to minimize blue light exposure.

I find that winding down with a fiction book helps me feel calm and ready for sleep. Additionally, I’ve incorporated warm milk and light snacks into my pre-sleep routine.

Ultimately, nothing compares to the restorative power of sleep. There’s no supplement or medication that can match its benefits. So, instead of trying to be hardcore, prioritize getting enough sleep. Establish a regular rhythm, and you’ll wake up fresh, with a better ability to retain what you’ve learned.

Give it a try, and remember: keep going, keep going, keep going. You’re going to do great!
